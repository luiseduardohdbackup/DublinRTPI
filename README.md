Dublin RTPI
===========

Dublin RTPI (Real Time Passenger Information) Android &amp; iOS App powered by Xamarin

You can use this project to learn how to create cross-platform map apps with xamarin. You could also create a fork and use it as base project.

We will add support for other public transport services( e.g. http://www.buseireann.ie/) and platforms (e.g. Windows Phone, OSX) in the future.

Hope you enjoy it!
