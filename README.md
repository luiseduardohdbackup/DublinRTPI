Dublin RTPI
===========

Dublin RTPI (Real Time Passenger Information) Android &amp; iOS App powered by Xamarin

You can use this project to learn how to create cross-platform map apps with xamarin. You could also create a fork and use it as base project.

We will add support for other public transport services (e.g. Bus Eireann) and platforms (e.g. Windows Phone) in the future.

Hope you enjoy it!
